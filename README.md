## THE SHIT I DO FOR A PRETTY COMPUTER ##
My (lunatek) dotfiles for hyprland

The symlink_simple.sh script will just create symlinks for everything, and needs the whole repo to be placed in the users home directory"~/"
The other script is broken (i suck at ts) I will fix it at a later date

Thers also no script for installing the stuff I need atm so thats in the works too i guess
