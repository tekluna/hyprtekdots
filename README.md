## HYPRTEKDOTS ##

Hi this my my personal dotfiles repo, I made it to function with my [dotfile installer script](https://github.com/tekluna/tekkibles) but you can just look around and take what you like.

There are a few crappy scripts in there I use to automate stuff like changeing walpapers and syncing the colors using `pywall`
