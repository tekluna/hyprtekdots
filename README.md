## HYPRTEKDOTS ##

Hi this my personal dotfiles repo. I made it to function with my [dotfile installer script](https://github.com/tekluna/tekkibles) but you can just look around and take what you like.

There are a few crappy scripts in there I use to automate stuff like changeing walpapers and syncing the colors using [`polybar`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

##THE DOTFILES##
The dotfiles are scrucuted to be used with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so you can just clone this repo and run `stow nameofpackage` to symlink the files into the correct places.
